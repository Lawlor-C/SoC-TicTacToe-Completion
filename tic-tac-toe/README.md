This is a solo-completion project forked from my Team's work during Week 7 on School of Code.

Having found myself out of practice following completion of the course, I've decided to revisit some incomplete work and see it through to a level I'm happy with, both as a way to re-establish what I've learned and to update the portfolio I wish I'd developed during the course, had I the time.

This is the first of the projects I've revisited. I intend to document these as clearly as possible and retain the original repo names for transparency.

Original repo can be found here: https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/week-7-react-tictactoe-team-threeact - at that stage, my team had a working grid of 3x3 which would populate an X or an O, only if the button clicked were still in its preset null state. No win conditions had been implemented but a Reset button was functional.

I will complete the functionality and apply suitable css standards.
