This is a solo-completion project forked from my Team's work during Week 7 on School of Code.

Having found myself out of practice following completion of the course, I've decided to revisit some incomplete work and see it through to a level I'm happy with, both as a way to re-establish what I've learned and to update the portfolio I wish I'd developed during the course, had I the time.

This is the first of the projects I've revisited. I intend to document these as clearly as possible and retain the original repo names for transparency.

Original repo can be found here: https://github.com/SchoolOfCode/week-7-react-tictactoe-team-threeact - at that stage, my team had a working grid of 3x3 which would populate an X or an O, only if the button clicked were still in its preset null state. No win conditions had been implemented but a Reset button was functional.

I will complete the functionality and apply suitable css standards.

Update: Having implemented the functionality for Win and Stalemate states, and somewhat improved the css, I feel attempting to further stylise the css at this stage is unproductive. The components are not laid out how I'd have done them and so overlaps are causing more issues than are worth solving for such a minor project.
I feel perhaps making a similar app from scratch will be a more productive use of my time.

Update - I have had to duplicate this project into a new repo as the SoC original file from which we forked ispPrivate, thus any forks are inherently Private.
